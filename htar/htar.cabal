synopsis:        Command-line tar archive utility.
description:     A Command-line utility to create, extract and list the
                 contents of tar archives. It can work with compressed
                 archives using gzip or bzip2 compression.
                 .
                 This is in part a demo of the @tar@ library but it is also
                 usable in place of the ordinary @tar@ program for systems
                 like Windows that do not come with it as standard.
