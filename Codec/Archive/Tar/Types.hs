-- * Tar paths
--

-- | The classic tar format allowed just 100 characters for the file name. The
-- USTAR format extended this with an extra 155 characters, however it uses a
-- complex method of splitting the name between the two sections.
--
-- Instead of just putting any overflow into the extended area, it uses the
-- extended area as a prefix. The aggravating insane bit however is that the
-- prefix (if any) must only contain a directory prefix. That is the split
-- between the two areas must be on a directory separator boundary. So there is
-- no simple calculation to work out if a file name is too long. Instead we
-- have to try to find a valid split that makes the name fit in the two areas.
--
-- The rationale presumably was to make it a bit more compatible with old tar
-- programs that only understand the classic format. A classic tar would be
-- able to extract the file name and possibly some dir prefix, but not the
-- full dir prefix. So the files would end up in the wrong place, but that's
-- probably better than ending up with the wrong names too.
--
-- So it's understandable but rather annoying.
--
-- * Tar paths use Posix format (ie @\'/\'@ directory separators), irrespective
--   of the local path conventions.
--
-- * The directory separator between the prefix and name is /not/ stored.
--

-- clearer to use the provided functions for mapping, folding and unfolding.
--
-- Converting from a list can be done with just @foldr Next Done@. Converting
-- back into a list can be done with 'foldEntries' however in that case you
-- must be prepared to handle the 'Fail' case inherent in the 'Entries' type.

-- archive.
