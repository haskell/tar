-- | Creates a tar archive from a list of directory or files. Any directories
-- specified will have their contents included recursively. Paths in the
-- archive will be relative to the given base directory.
--
-- This is a portable implementation of packing suitable for portable archives.
-- In particular it only constructs 'NormalFile' and 'Directory' entries. Hard
-- links and symbolic links are treated like ordinary files. It cannot be used
-- to pack directories containing recursive symbolic links. Special files like
-- FIFOs (named pipes), sockets or device files will also cause problems.
--
-- An exception will be thrown for any file names that are too long to
-- represent as a 'TarPath'.
--
-- * This function returns results lazily. Subdirectories are scanned
-- and files are read one by one as the list of entries is consumed.

-- | This is a utility function, much like 'getDirectoryContents'. The
-- difference is that it includes the contents of subdirectories.
--
-- The paths returned are all relative to the top directory. Directory paths
-- are distinguishable by having a trailing path separator
-- (see 'FilePath.Native.hasTrailingPathSeparator').
--
-- All directories are listed before the files that they contain. Amongst the
-- contents of a directory, subdirectories are listed after normal files. The
-- overall result is that files within a directory will be together in a single
-- contiguous group. This tends to improve file layout and IO performance when
-- creating or extracting tar archives.
--
-- * This function returns results lazily. Subdirectories are not scanned
-- until the files entries in the parent directory have been consumed.
